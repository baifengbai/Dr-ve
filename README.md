# Dr!ve
System that detects when a driver is drunk or when the driver falls asleep to prevent accidents and save lives

Dr!ve uses a Intel RealSense 3D camera to detect when a driver has fallen asleep, or is under the influence of alcohol. When it detects a sleeping driver, an iOS app plays an alarm in an attempt to wake the driver up. It also detects drops in pulse rates in a driver, compared to a calibrated amount, along with erratic expressions on the drivers face. These can be telltale signs that a driver is under the influence, and it displays a message that tells the driver not to drive in such conditions, calls the users ICE contact, and gives the option to open the uber app to get a ride.
